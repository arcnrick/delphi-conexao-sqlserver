Delphi - Test connection to SQLServer database at run time.


Project developed in Delphi showing how to pass connection string for ADO connection component at runtime in order to attempt connection to the SQLServer database.
In the sample, I read the database and the server of an edit, but could be from a * .ini or * .xml file as well.
